## Introduction

Algorithms are essential building blocks in computer science and software development. Many algorithmic problems have specific patterns and techniques that can be applied to efficiently solve them. AlgoCraft: Mastering Patterns provides a collection of algorithms, each showcasing how to apply various patterns, such as sliding window, two pointer, and more, to tackle different problem scenarios.

## Features

- A curated set of algorithmic problems solved using popular patterns.
- Detailed explanations and step-by-step solutions for each problem.
- Well-organized code examples in multiple programming languages.
- Easy-to-follow documentation and instructions.

## Getting Started

To get started with AlgoCraft, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/AlgoCraft.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd AlgoCraft`
3. Choose the problem you want to explore in the respective directory.

## Usage

Each problem in AlgoCraft is organized into its own directory, containing the problem statement, code examples, and explanations. You can explore the different algorithmic patterns used to solve each problem.

To run the code examples, make sure you have the required programming language installed. Follow the instructions provided in each problem's directory.

## Algorithmic Patterns

AlgoCraft: Mastering Patterns currently focuses on the following algorithmic techniques:

- Sliding Window
- Two Pointer
- (More patterns will be added in future updates.)

Each pattern comes with a detailed explanation of its concept, along with real-world examples to solidify your understanding.
